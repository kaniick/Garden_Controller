# Growtek Controller

Growtek is an automation system for my raised garden bed(s). It has the capability to communicate with my home automation system (SARAH). By allowing
the system to communicate with 'SARAH' I am able to allow the controller to act without human intervention. Additionally, I am able to
control the system and monitor it remotely. The information/data the system generates is available for future projects.

## System Capabilities

The systems main capability is to monitor and water the raised garden bed.

```
 * Monitor atmospheric temperature and humidity
 * Monitor soil moisture
 * Control electronic solenoid Valve
 * Control Fans inside control box
```
Additional features will be added at a later date.

```
 * Information Screen with System data
 * Monitor UV Light
 * Monitor Light and measure in Lux
 * Add additional soil moisture sensors
 * Add LED lights to system
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
 * [Atom IO](https://www.atom.io/) - The hackable text editor
 * [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/) - Arduino IDE
 * [MySensors](https://www.mysensors.org/) - DIY Automation Framework
```
Additionally, you will need to construct a gateway for the Growtek to communicate with which will then communicate with various home automation systems.
more infomation on the gateway can be found on the MySensors Website.

### Installing

 ```
 I will write the installation at a later date.
 ```

## Running the tests

```
I will write the installation at a later date.
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [Atom IO](https://www.atom.io/) - The hackable text editor
* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - Powered by Arduino
* [MySensors](https://www.mysensors.org) - DIY Home Automation
